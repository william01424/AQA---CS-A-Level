## Data Types

### Data Type = is defined by the values it can take or the operations which can be performed on it.

It is possible to store one piece of data using various data types - must decide which is best suited. i.e. Age can be str or int.

      - Integer = 6, -1, 0
      - Float = 34.53453 , -3242.234234
      - Boolean = True / False
      - Character = 'm'
      - String = 'hello world'
      - Date / Time = Available in all most all languages to assist with the storing of dates and times.
      - Pointer / Reference = Declare a variable that can be used to 'point' to a physical address in memory.
      - Records = Composed of related data of various other data types. It is divied into names fields. Think of a record as a row from a table.
      - Arrays = (Same as lists for Python) ['Dave', 'John', 'William']

### User-defined Data Types

Built-in data types are useful, but often limiting. Languages allow you to construct your own complex user-defined data types.

## Programming Concepts

      - Variable declaration = Creating a variable for the first time, giving it a name (and sometimes a data type).
                               This alllocates a portion of computer memory to the variable.
      - Constant declaration = Same as variable declaration, but this value is constant i.e. won't change when program is running.
      
      - Assignment           = Giving a constant a variable or a value.
      - Iteration            = Repeating an instruction (can be definite or indefinite.
      - Selection            = Comparing values and then choosing an action based on those values.
      - Subroutine           = A named block of code containing a set of instructions designed to perform a frequently used operation.
      
### Definite and indefinite iteration

Process of repeating a block of code. Examples of this are for and while loops.

      - Definite             =  Type of iteration in which the number of repetitions required is known before the loop starts.
      - Indefinite           =  Type of iteration in which the number of repetitions required is not known before the loop starts.

'''for i in range(60):
  print(i)
'''
'''a = 1

while a == 1:
    b = input("Enter your name\n")
    print('Hi, ', b, 'This is an infinite loop!!')
'''
### Nested Structures

Selection strucutures and iteration structures can be nested. i.e. one strucutre is placed within another structure - easily identified by indentation (easier for humans to read)

'''for i in range(10):
    if i < 5:
        print('Hello numbers <5')
    else:
        if i == 6:
            print('6 is boring :(')
        else:
            print('bigger numbers are cool')
'''
